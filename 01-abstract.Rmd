# Abstract {- }

The emergence of Covid-19 and the enforcement of restrictions on movement of goods and services brought world economy to a standstill. The unanticipated disruption in global supply chain and movement of goods and services had deteriorated trade volumes globally. Due to the pandemic, most economic indicators reported poor performance; international trade is not an exception and this decline in economic indicators is expected to continue through the Covid-19 period. Against this wider belief, this study uses Intervention time series analysis and find that the impact of Covid-19 on India's trade indicators are a temporary phenomenon. Results from our empirical exercise provide evidence that post-intervention trade indicators might improve.

abstract = {This study investigates how the effects of COVID-19 on international trade changed over time. To do that, we explore monthly data on worldwide trade from January to August in 2019 and 2020. Specifically, our study data include the exports of 34 countries to 173 countries. We estimated the gravity equation by employing various variables as a proxy for the COVID-19 damage. Our findings can be summarized as follows: First, regardless of our measures to quantify the COVID-19 pandemic, we found significantly negative effects of COVID-19 on the international trade of both exporting and importing countries. Second, those effects, especially the effects of COVID-19 in importing countries, tended to become insignificant since July 2020. This result implies that the harmful impacts of COVID-19 on international trade were accommodated after the first wave of the pandemic to some extent. Third, we found heterogeneous effects across industries. The negative effects on non-essential, durable products persist for a long time, whereas positive effects in industries providing medical products were observed.},

abstract = {Time series analysis methods have been applied to a large number of practical problems, including modeling and forecasting economic time series and process and quality control. One aspect of time series analysis is the use of discrete linear transfer functions to model the interrelationships between input and output time series. This paper is an introduction to the identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking of these models. Some aspects of forecasting with transfer function models are also discussed. A survey of intervention analysis models in which the input series is an indicator variable corresponding to an isolated event thought to influence the output is also given. Familiarity with univariate autoregressive integrated moving average modeling is assumed. Extensions to more general multiple time series analysis methods are also briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Chong2021,
abstract = {Starting in December 2019, COVID-19 had been spreading across the world on a limited scale for a quarter until March 2020 when the death toll in the countries comprising the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) finally started to mount. However, despite the relatively late outbreak in the region, the ASEAN market had already plunged along with other regional markets across the world amid heightened concern about the economic impact of the biggest viral killer in 2020. In this paper, we examine the economic impact of coronavirus on different ASEAN countries separately by analysing their respective economic figures for the first two quarters in 2020. This allows us to delineate the overall picture of its impact on ASEAN countries as well as to provide an estimation for the future outlook of the ASEAN economic bloc. We propose that the slowing growth, the sluggish recovery of trade and the cross-country transmission of unemployment are three significant risk factors that the ASEAN economies are faced with.},

abstract = {Financial technology, or FinTech, involves the design and delivery of financial products and services through technology. It impacts financial institutions, regulators, customers, and merchants across a wide range of industries. Pervasive digital technologies are challenging the fundamentals of the highly regulated financial sector, leading to the emergence of non-traditional payment systems, peer-to-peer money exchanges and increased turbulence in currency markets. This case study explores the development of a FinTech company in China that offers microloans to college students. Five lessons learned are presented for organizations to better manage the challenges and to leverage the opportunities amidst the disruption of financial sector. Our findings also shed light on how digital technology 1) offers the strategic capability for a firm to occupy a market niche in financial sector, 2) enables the generation of alternative credit scores based on non-traditional data, and 3) improves the financial inclusion of previously excluded market segments.},

@article{Vidya2020a,
abstract = {The present paper empirically analyzes the structural change in world trade over the last two decades by examining trade integration, leadership, and regionalization through a network model. We selected 50 countries encompassing both developed and developing nations and grouped them into 9 regions for 1990, 1992, 2000, 2010, and 2017. We have undertaken two principal analyses: (i) trade intensity indices and regionalization and (ii) linking trade intensity with network analysis. Therefore, this paper reaches a trade-off condition. The major findings of the study are as follows: (i) regional integration is stronger and has increased over the years; (ii) trade regionalization is primarily dominated by developed regions; (iii) trade liberalization has reduced the gap between the center and periphery; (iv) emerging Asian economies have developed as leaders and export hubs of goods in the global market; (v) trade liberalization has transformed and reshaped the world trade structure; and (vi) trade liberalization has not driven the lessening geodesic distance and transport costs from trade, and thus, there are no major gains for many countries.},

In an interrupted time-series analysis, an outcome variable is observed over multiple, equally spaced time periods before and after the introduction of an intervention that is expected to interrupt its level or trend. The itsa command estimates the effect of an intervention on an outcome variable either for a single treatment group or when compared with one or more control groups. Additionally, its options allow the user to control for autocorrelated disturbances and to estimate treatment effects over multiple periods.},

@article{Veeramani2021,
abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak has put the global economic scenario out of order. The mechanism of lockdown and social distancing has paved a grave situation for global trade in general and services in particular as they are inseparable and requires proximity between the supplier and the consumer. In view of the outstanding contribution of services in India's foreign trade, this study examines the impact of the pandemic on aggregate, sectoral and mode-wise services exports from India. It ultimately seeks to highlight key opportunities, challenges and suggestions to protect and promote India's services interest amid this global disruption. We review the quarterly and monthly services exports patterns from January to July 2020 based on the data obtained from the World Trade Organization and the Reserve Bank of India. The perspective on mode-wise services exports is derived from the Trade-in Services by Modes of Supply (TISMOS) data set of the WTO for 2017. The analysis highlights a severe drop in overall services exports, by over 10{\%} during the second quarter of 2020. Travel, transport and financial services have been hit hardest. However, the decline in India's services exports found as relatively much lower in comparison to other major services exporting economies. The comparative edge in digital or Mode 1 services offers greater opportunities for the country in the longer period if urgent policy initiatives and support are extended to potential online services sectors.},

abstract = {India witnessed demonetisation in November 2016, when high value denomination notes of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 were withdrawn at a single stroke which extinguished about 86 percent of the total currency value in circulation. Demonetisation which aimed to curb black money, terror funding and counterfeiting at the first place, was later projected as the government's push for digitalisation drive. In this paper, we analyse the effect of demonetisation on digital payments viz. debit card, point of sale transactions, and mobile transactions using an intervention analysis of time series. The findings of the Study negate the impact of demonetisation on digitalisation of the Indian economy.},

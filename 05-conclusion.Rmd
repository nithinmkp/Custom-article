# Conclusion {#sec5}
Our study analyse the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on Indiaâ€™s export, import and trade balance. Prior to Covid-19, both export and import exhibit a declining trend, however decline in imports is more than exports and results in favorable growth in trade balance. Once Covid-19 associated lockdown restrictions were introduced, exports and imports declined drastically in the month of intervention.  Our results are in contradiction with initial predictions of deterioration in trade for a longer period. From our empirical exercise, we observe that Indian trade improves significantly after the immediate decline. Easing of pandemic related restrictions might have helped the economy to regain its pre-pandemic peak in the trade indicators.
